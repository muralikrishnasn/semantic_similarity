# Data Science Notebooks


This is a sandbox type repository for my personal data science related learning projects. Nothing special, just a beginner trying to learn machine learning and some data science.

## About My Setup

### Anaconda

I'm using Anaconda as my environment.

Anaconda is a free distribution of the Python programming language for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

Follow instructions to install [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).

### Running Notebooks

You must first clone or download the repository then run the notebook.

More information about Jupyter Notebooks can be found [here.](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

    $ git clone https://github.com/Kurkulis/data_science_notebooks.git
    $ cd ai_notebooks
    $ jupyter notebook

Sometimes I also just use VSCode for the notebooks. I am a JavaScript developer so it is a more familiar editor for me. More information about working with Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode can be found [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support)

    $ git clone https://github.com/Kurkulis/data_science_notebooks.git
    $ cd ai_notebooks
    $ code .
